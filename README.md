A book review website similar in spirit to Goodreads. Users are able to register with a username and password. Once registered, a user can view or leave reviews on a book. A user can query books in the database by tittle, author, or ISBN. The app also uses a third-party API to pull in ratings for query searches performed by the user. The app also supports direct query access via a JSON API route.
